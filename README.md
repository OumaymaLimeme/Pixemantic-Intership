# Pixemantic-Intership
My Project in my First Internship as a Computer Science Student

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4.

During my internship at Pixemantic as a 1st year student at Enicarthage, I am called upon to work on the frontend part of their official website through which I exploit my knowledge and skills acquired during our training in order to to result in a Web application based completely on Angular well built.
